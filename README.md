Audio Visualizer

A modular, file-based audio visualization app. Load any audio file and watch its waveform and frequency spectrum come alive. Designed for clarity, extensibility, and creative exploration.

Features
 • File-based audio input: No system audio capture headaches—just pick a file and go.
 • Waveform and spectrum visualization: See both the shape and the soul of your sound.
 • Modular design: Each class has a clear responsibility, making it easy to extend or remix.

How It Works
 1. AudioLoader: Handles file selection and decoding.
 2. AudioProcessor: Extracts waveform and frequency data.
 3. Visualizer: Draws the visuals (waveform, spectrum, etc.).
 4. AudioVisualizerApp (GUI): Orchestrates the flow and user interaction.

Getting Started
 1. Clone the repository.
 2. Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt

 3. Run the app:python main.py

 4. Pick an audio file and watch the magic.

Why This Approach?

By focusing on file-based input, you avoid the friction of system-level audio capture and build a foundation that’s easy to explain, extend, and share. Each class is a riff—together, they make a song.

Extending the App
 • Add new visualizations (spectrograms, 3D shapes, etc.)
 • Support playlists or batch processing
 • Integrate with MIDI or real-time input (if you want to get wild)
